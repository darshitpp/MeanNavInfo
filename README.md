# MeanNavInfo

This NodeJS API was developed to show all the latest NAVs of Indian Mutual Funds.

My plan: 

* Fetch NAV information from https://www.amfiindia.com/

* Clean the file

* Plug it into a non-relational data store like MongoDB

* Make the values to be queried by the user based on Scheme Code

* Schedule a CRON job to automate this process

* Deploy on Heroku
